## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

\`\`\`env
# Turnstile Configuration (Optional - for production)
TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your_turnstile_site_key
TURNSTILE_SECRET=your_turnstile_secret_key

# Alternative: reCAPTCHA (if preferred over Turnstile)
RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_recaptcha_site_key
RECAPTCHA_SECRET=your_recaptcha_secret_key
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies
\`\`\`bash
npm install
\`\`\`

### 3. Run Development Server
\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

### 4. Production Deployment

#### Cloudflare Setup (Recommended)
1. Deploy behind Cloudflare for DDoS protection and WAF
2. Enable Cloudflare Managed Rules for OWASP Top 10 protection
3. Configure rate limiting rules
4. Set up Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) to hide origin server

#### Security Headers Configuration
Ensure your hosting platform or CDN applies the security headers. For Vercel, create `vercel.json`:

\`\`\`json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Strict-Transport-Security",
          "value": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        },
        {
          "key": "X-Frame-Options",
          "value": "DENY"
        },
        {
          "key": "Referrer-Policy",
          "value": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

### 5. Turnstile Integration

1. Get Turnstile keys from Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Add keys to environment variables
3. Update the contact form component to include the Turnstile widget
